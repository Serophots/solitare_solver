 - Put up all the aces
 - Make all moves
 - Consider only putting cards up from the table and not the deck, unless moving up from deck enables a move up from table

A move is positive if:
 - It creates space and there are kings in placing queue
 - It reveals a card beneath
 - It enables another move


Pair card = card of same number and colour

Duplicate cards:
 - if cards pair card is on the aces, place it
 - if cards pair card is in upturned, place it
 - If both pair cards are upturned, freely place next card on either
 - If both pair cards are in the deck, place them freely


 Game loop:
 - Put up any aces
 - Consider putting up further cards onto aces if they're positive moves
 - Consider moves within the table
 - Consider moves from draw-deck to table
